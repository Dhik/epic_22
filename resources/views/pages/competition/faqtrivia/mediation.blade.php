This is also supported by the large number of internet users in Indonesia, namely 196.7 million people as of the second quarter of 2020 which has caused the startup movement to be quite free in Indonesia. The increasing number of startups and internet users in Indonesia is also caused by the COVID-19 pandemic which has triggered startup pioneers to present solutions to various sectors as well as the increasing number of internet users because many sectors have moved from offline to online systems. The relationship between startups and the internet is expected to restore the digital economy.</p>
