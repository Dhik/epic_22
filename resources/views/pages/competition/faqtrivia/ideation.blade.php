			<p class="desc_comp">&emsp;&emsp;The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) revealed the possibility of earth's temperature to reach or exceed 1,5°C in a shorter period of time, possibly between 2018 to 2037. This statement is in line with research found in the Nature Climate Change Journal which predicts that rising global temperatures will cause extreme sea level rise along coastlines around the world and will occur a hundred times more frequently by the end of this century. Rising sea levels can cause massive floods to occur in several coastal areas worldwide once every hundred years. Apart from massive floods, climate change may affect the earth in other ways, from natural consequences such as water scarcity that leads to increased droughts, more severe storms, extreme weather, forest fires and melting polar ice caps that leads to loss of species, to social consequences such as a global rise in hunger, health risks, poverty, and displacement.</p>
			<p class="desc_comp">&emsp;&emsp; Based on these data, as students who act as agents of change, we must pay great attention and actively find solutions towards the impacts of the ongoing climate change. Real actions can be done through various efforts, such as educating people on the impacts of climate change, how to adapt and take proper actions amid extreme events that occur due to climate change. These efforts can be done by utilizing the ever growing digital media technology that currently covers almost all aspects of human life.</p>
