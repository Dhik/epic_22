			<p class="desc_ideation">&emsp;&emsp;Katadata Insight Center stated that there are two obstacles faced by MSMEs (Bahasa: UMKM) in adapting during this pandemic, especially in digital marketing. Some MSMEs admit that they lack knowledge in running online businesses, while some stated that they do not have a competent workforce. Based on data from the Ministry of Cooperatives and Small and Medium Enterprises (Kemenkop and UKM) as of June 2020, only 8 million out of 64 million MSMEs in Indonesia have utilized digital media. This data shows the lack of digital media use for business among MSMEs businessmen in Indonesia.</p>
			<p class="desc_ideation">&emsp;&emsp; Meanwhile, women's MSMEs experienced a decrease in turnover of 96% due to struggles in marketing products through digital media. Digital media is the main support for business continuity of 92% of MSMEs that survived throughout this pandemic. Women have great potential in developing Indonesia’s economy through MSMEs. According to the Ministry of Cooperatives and SMEs (2017), as much as 64.5% of the total of MSMEs in Indonesia, or an equivalent of 37 million MSMEs, are managed by women. Also, according to McKinsey, there are at least four advantages in digitizing women MSMEs, namely increased sales, job-creating, price saving, and social equality.</p>
