The tourism industry has experienced a downturn by up to 90% starting from the start of the COVID-19 outbreak in 2019, one of them is the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME). Executive Director of the National Committee for Syariah Economics and Finance, Ventje Rahardjo reported that 72.6 percent of MSMEs were affected due to the Covid-19 pandemic. This has a huge impact considering the MSMEs have a contribution of 60 percent of the national Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Many MSMEs experienced a reduction in activity due to the policy of limiting social interactions which resulted in the cessation of the production process. Due to the widespread of the Covid-19 pandemic, MSMEs actors are expected to have a good preparation for raw materials and also for the human resource.</p>
