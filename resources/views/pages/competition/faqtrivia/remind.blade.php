			<p class="desc_comp">&emsp;&emsp; Social media is one of the driving factors for the emergence of fast fashion. For example, when an influencer posts a photo wearing a new outfit, the followers will try to imitate the influencer's style of dress. This will cause fast fashion brands to compete with each other to be the first to provide it. Fast fashion brands often target young people as the biggest social media users. In fact, according to a survey by the Fashion Retail Academy, nearly 75% of kids aged 18-24 believe that influencers have a huge impact on the rise of fast fashion.</p>
			<p class="desc_comp">&emsp;&emsp; Fast fashion brands encourage consumers to continue to buy clothes at low prices and tear them away in a short period of time because of poor-quality clothes. This cycle can create serious environmental problems. Every day, the world collects mountains of non-biodegradable textile waste. The emergence of fast fashion has disastrous consequences, from dependence on synthetic fabrics, its carbon waste that can pollute the environment, to the disruption of the health of garment workers.</p>
            <p class="desc_comp">&emsp;&emsp; Some famous fast fashion brands use toxic chemicals, harmful dyes, and synthetic fabrics that can contaminate water. Every year, at least 11 million tons of clothing are thrown away in the US. The clothes were full of lead, pesticides, and countless other chemicals. Therefore, landfills release a lot of toxins into the air. Besides having an impact on the environment, fast fashion also has an impact on the health of consumers and garment workers. These days, harmful chemicals such as benzothiazole are found in many clothes and can cause certain types of cancer and respiratory diseases. The skin is one of the sensitive organs of the body, wearing poorly made clothes can be harmful to our health.</p>
