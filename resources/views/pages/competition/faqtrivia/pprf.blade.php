					<p class="desc_ideation">&emsp;&emsp; <b>Q: How many competitions are there in PPRF?</br></br></b>"PPRF has 2 branches of competition, named OlymPRDay and Public Relations Student Forum (PRSF)."</p>

					<p class="desc_ideation">&emsp;&emsp; <b>Q: Who can join the PPRF?</br></br></b>"All D3/D4/S1 or equivalent students who have an active status until the running of Epicentrum in May 2022 throughout Indonesia, as well as outside Indonesia (PRSF)."</p>

					<p class="desc_ideation">&emsp;&emsp; <b>Q: What is OlymPRDay?</br></br></b>"OlymPRday is a branch of competition based on the PR Strategic Planning. This competition branch requires participants to be able to solve national problems through research skills, teamwork, and creativity. The final result of the OlymPRday competition is in the form of a Campaign Proposal as a resolution strategy for the issues raised."</p>

					<p class="desc_ideation">&emsp;&emsp; <b>Q: What is PRSF?</br></br></b>"PRSF is a competition in the form of a panel discussion which emphasizes the Public Relations perspective in providing solutions. Same as the previous year, PRSF will be held on an international scale which will include participants from various countries. The final result of PRSF competition is a Draft Resolution which contains communication recommendations to the government."</p>

					<p class="desc_ideation">&emsp;&emsp; <b>Q: How many sessions are there in PRSF?</br></br></b>"The PRSF is divided into two sessions, namely a formal session and an informal session."</p>

					<p class="desc_ideation">&emsp;&emsp; <b>Q: What is the difference between formal and informal sessions?</br></br></b>&emsp;&emsp;"The formal session requires delegates to present ideas related to the theme. The delegation gave speeches one by one and will be moderated by the chair as the leader of the discussion. In this session, delegates can propose topics that will be discussed by all delegates by practicing lobbying and negotiation. While in informal sessions, delegates will discuss topics without being moderated by a chair. In this session, delegates will be allowed to seek alliances and discuss informally. The expected output from this session is a draft resolution made by the alliance."</p>

					<p class="desc_ideation">&emsp;&emsp; <b>Q: What are the requirements for members in one OlymPRday and PRSF team?</br></br></b>"Participants are allowed to come from different faculties or study programs, as long as they are from the same university."</p>

					<p class="desc_ideation">&emsp;&emsp; <b>Q: What is the difference between MUN and PRSF?</br></br></b>"The procedure is adopted from MUN with some adjustments to prevent delegates' confusion. Because ultimately, PRSF emphasizes on Public Relations perspective. Also, delegates will discuss the topic related to the predetermined theme and will be representing their own team, not countries as it is in MUN"</p>

					<p class="desc_ideation">&emsp;&emsp; <b>Q: What dresscode should the participants wear for D-Day?</br></br></b>"Business attire"</p>

					<p class="desc_ideation">&emsp;&emsp; <b>Q: Where will the competition be held?</br></br></b>"Unfortunately, the competition will be held fully online through Zoom Meetings and any relevant conference call platforms. But we'll make sure you will still be able to feel the hype!"</p>

					<p class="desc_ideation">&emsp;&emsp; <b>Q: How can participants know that registration has been verified?</br></br></b>"Verification of registration can be proven by receiving the first brief via email to the team leaderâ€™s email within 1x24 work hour (9.00 AM - 9.00 PM GMT+7)"</p>

					<p class="desc_ideation">&emsp;&emsp; <b>Q: If I still have questions regarding the competitions, who should I contact?</b></p>
