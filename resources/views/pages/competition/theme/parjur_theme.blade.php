			<p class="desc_ideation">&emsp;&emsp; The global COVID-19 pandemic has devastated various sectors in Indonesia such as economics, education, to social culture. According to the Fiscal Policy Agency (Badan Kebijakan Fiskal) of Indonesian Ministry of Finance, at least the loss incurred by the pandemic reached around IDR 320 trillion or around 2.03% during the first quarter of 2020. To adapt with this condition, society must be creative, adaptive, and innovative. In the future, those will be our provision to live in a post pandemic world.</p>
			<p class="desc_ideation">&emsp;&emsp; In the media industry, innovation is necessarily required in the post pandemic world. Quoting Nielsen from The Conversation, although the traffic received by the media, especially online media during the pandemic, increased rapidly, in fact, advertising revenue has actually decreased by 25% to 3.5 trillion rupiah as of April 2020. This resulted from advertisers’ decision to invest in other sectors and make it difficult for the media to return their capital. Therefore, Journalistic Parade 2021, “Innovation All Around You” is here to put forward the synergy and role of the media. Aiming to facilitate Generation Z to find innovation and ideas of solution for the media in Indonesia to survive in the post pandemic world.</p>
