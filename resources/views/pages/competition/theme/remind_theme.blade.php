			<p class="theme-title">Persuasive Communication by Media to Reduce Fast Fashion Waste</p>
			<p class="desc_comp">&emsp;&emsp; Fast fashion is a design, manufacturing, and marketing method focused on mass-producing clothing in a short amount of time. One of the biggest impacts caused by the rise of the fast fashion industry is how the process (from production to consumption) plays a major role in climate change. This data is supported by the fact that 85% of United States textile waste ends up in landfills or is burned (Schlossberg, 2019).</p>
			<p class="desc_comp">&emsp;&emsp; It is estimated that in its manufacture, the textile industry emitted about 4 gigatons (Gt) in 2016, or 8.1% of global CO2 emissions. Similarly, a study of textile consumption in Sweden found that the consumption of fast fashion contributed to 14% of the total climate damage caused by the use of clothing (Niinimäki et all, 2020). In addition, in 2017 the EPRS stated that the textile industry was declared to contribute 10% of global carbon gas emissions which even exceed the amount generated from international flights and maritime shipping.</p>
			<p class="desc_comp">&emsp;&emsp; The phenomenon of fast fashion is concretely a problem of human consumerism, where we consume more than what we need. There are no technical solutions for fast fashion products; the only solution is within the consumer itself (Linden, 2016). Therefore, persuasive communication can be used to increase public awareness of environmental issues and increase environmental education.</p>
			<p class="desc_comp">&emsp;&emsp; Environmental education is a way to form knowledge, understanding, attitudes, abilities, and awareness between a person and a group in protecting the environment (Sola, 2014). The media can act as an external factor that can influence public opinion and behavior. An appropriate communication strategy is also needed so that persuasive communication is able to achieve the goal of reducing climate damage due to fast fashion.</p>
