			<p class="desc_comp">&emsp;&emsp; At this time, Indonesia is being hit by the Covid-19 pandemic which has a direct impact on various sectors of life, starting from the education, economy, social, health and other sectors including the tourism industry.  The impact of the Covid - 19 pandemic is not trivial. Indonesia has experienced an emergency crisis that continues to spread to problems at the macro level in various sectors. From the previous problem, the Epicentrum Unpad Communication Competition Festival had the theme Indonesia Recovery. Based on the main theme, Research Mindedness determined a more specific theme to be the theme for the Remind 2021 competition, namely Collaborative Communications to Dignify Local Tourism Industry. </p>
			<p class="desc_comp">&emsp;&emsp; Through the theme EPICENTRUM: Indonesia Recovery in the Research Mindedness: "Collaborative Communications to Dignify Local Tourism Industry", young people are challenged to research collaboration opportunities as a communication strategy that can be carried out by Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (UMKM) actors. The form of collaboration in the strategy is expected to include one or more elements of Pentahelix (central and/or regional government, business actors, academics, communities, and the media). The formulation of a communication strategy with collaboration is expected to strengthen Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (UMKM), especially those in tourist areas as well as those producing and/or selling products with regional identity, as an effort to post-pandemic resilience and recovery.</p>
