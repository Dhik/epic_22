			<p class="desc_comp_tav">&emsp;&emsp; In this pandemic, there has been some regulations as a form of adaptability to prevent the spread of Covid-19. One of the example is when Minister of Education Nadiem Makarim changes the school system where the students receive the lessons from home. To make sure the students receive a good amount of education, Minister of Education released educational television program “Belajar dari Rumah” on TVRI. According to Nielsen, from March 11th until March 18th 2020 there was an increase in television average viewing rate, from 12% to 13,8% or equivalent to addition of one million audience. In the same period of time, there was a big increase in television viewing duration, from originally 4 hours and 48 minutes to 5 hours 29 minutes.</p>
			<p class="desc_comp_tav">&emsp;&emsp; Because of the increase in television viewing audience, the television have a chance to collaborate with education elements to make educational television programs that are not only entertaining, but also educational. In this way the programs that appear in television will be more variative and balance.</p>
			<p class="desc_comp_tav">&emsp;&emsp; In order to support the educational television prgrams, HIMA TVF choose “Pendidikan dalam Layar Kaca (Education within Television)” as our theme. We choose this theme because the educational television programs are less and less day by day, also it’s rarely we see them last long. That thing happen mostly because the audience have a tendency to watches drama, dangdut shows, or gossip shows like Rumpi and Silet rather than educational programs. Looking to that thing appear some questions, how television’s role to persuade people to watch educational television programs? How the television can make an intersting educational programs?  Therefore, “Pendidikan dalam Layar Kaca (Education within Television)” is a theme for HIMA TVF to see how people respond the television as one of the education medium, especially in this pandemic.</p>
			<p class="desc_comp_tav">&emsp;&emsp; There are some reasons why we choose “Pendidikan dalam Layar Kaca (Education within Television)” as our theme. First, to return the positive side of the television where the television is supposed to be the media that give positive impact by showing programs that beneficial for the audience. As stated in the opening of  UUD1945, one of  Indonesia’s goal is to “Mencerdaskan kehidupan bangsa.” It’s hoped that television will be able to become a bridge to achieve this goal.</p>
			<p class="desc_comp_tav">&emsp;&emsp; Second, to give an opportunities for the academics to get involve in the television programs making process. With that involvement, those educational programs will become the learning media that have more creativity, innovative, and communicative. Third, It’s hoped that the television can become the learning media (especially for the children) through the education contents that they design to be creative and appealing so the audience are not gonna feel bored.</p>
			<p class="desc_comp_tav">&emsp;&emsp; Looking at those phenomenon, HIMA TVF want to invite you to contribute and support the educational tellevision programs by making a proposal design with “Pendidikan dalam Layar Kaca (Education within Television)” as its theme.</p>
