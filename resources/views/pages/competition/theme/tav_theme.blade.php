				<p class="desc_comp_tav">&emsp;&emsp; <b> “Social Climate : Through Humans Lens” </b> is the theme that Commoviecator 2022 choose. Commoviecator's main theme for this year is “Social Climate Through the Human Lens”. The climate crisis that is currently happening has a massive impact on the social and economic life of the society. There are marginal groups or minorities who are most affected by this climate crisis. However, the issue's coverage in mass media, especially in the movies, is not exposed enough.</p>
				<p class="desc_comp_tav">&emsp;&emsp; Commoviecator wants to present varied perspectives from various groups of people, especially marginalized communities as a form of channeling narratives and advocacy about what is happening in the field to the wider community through audio-visual works.</p>
