			<div class="desc_overlay">
			<p class="desc_medi">&emsp;&emsp; Startup is a new business created by young entrepreneurs through digital services with unlimited innovation and creativity. With the current rapid development of digital media, this indirectly demands that all people use digital media in various aspects of life.</p>
			<p class="desc_medi">&emsp;&emsp; Technology-based start-ups (startups) are among the hardest hit by the crisis due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Before the pandemic occurred, the majority of startups in Indonesia were in good condition. However, the situation reversed as the community's economic activity decreased. This can be seen from the Katadata Insight Center (KIC) survey of 139 digital startup executives in May-June 2020. At the end of 2019, there were 74.8% startups that were in good condition and very well. But now only 33% of startups are in good condition, and 42.5% admit that they are in bad condition. The worsening condition of the startup cannot be separated from the various policies taken by the government to contain the spread of COVID-19 (for example: the existence of PSBB or Large-Scale Social Restrictions).</p>
			<p class="desc_medi">&emsp;&emsp; The Ministry of Industry has again launched the Startup 4 Industry program as a concrete manifestation of implementing the Making Indonesia 4.0 road map. This strategic step is believed to be able to bridge the needs of industry players and the community towards the role of startups as technology providers. According to the 2020 Global Startup Ecosystem Report (GSER), Indonesia is ranked second in the Top 100 Emerging Ecosystem, which shows that the startup ecosystem in Indonesia has been formed. This means that Indonesia is one of the countries that investors are interested in investing in the startup sector.</p>
			<p class="desc_medi">&emsp;&emsp;We are aware that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, various activities such as shopping, work, studying, and economic activities have shifted to the digital world. Seeing this, it will lead to digital acceleration, namely the growth of digital media which in turn brings even greater changes to people's lifestyles. So, the acceleration of digital media is an increase in the adaptability of society which plays a role in accelerating the use of digital media during a pandemic to post-pandemic.</p>
			<p class="desc_medi">&emsp;&emsp;We hope that the sub-themes that we raise can restore Indonesia's economy which has been slumped due to the COVID-19 pandemic. With this digital acceleration, people who have startup businesses can develop it through digital media.</p>
