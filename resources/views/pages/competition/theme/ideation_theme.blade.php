			<p class="desc_ideation">&emsp;&emsp;During this Covid-19 Pandemic, 96% of women-owned Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) (bahasa: UMKM) had lost their profit due to their inability of digital marketing. This is caused by the lack of access to digital literacy that women had. It is recorded that only 48% of women in Indonesia have access to the internet globally. Moreover, not all of them use the internet for their businesses. Even though 92% of MSMEs who survived during the pandemic stated that digital platforms were the main factor of their business sustainability.</p>
			<p class="desc_ideation">&emsp;&emsp; In fact, according to the Ministry of Female Empowerment and Child Protection of Indonesia (Kementerian PPPA), women have high potential to improve the Indonesian economy through MSMEs. Based on the data from the Ministry of Cooperatives in 2014-2018, 99.99% of businesses in Indonesia are MSMEs where 64,5% of them are owned by women. Empowering women in Indonesia could add 9% above business as usual in 2025.</p>
			<p class="desc_ideation">&emsp;&emsp; There are at least four advantages of the digital economy carried out by women MSMEs, namely increased sales, job creation, price savings, and even social equality, which are in harmony with the National Economic Recovery Program in Indonesia by the United Nations. They need support from the government, businesses, private sector, and civil society to help women through digital marketing to advance women's economic empowerment and minimize the gender gap that exists in the labor market in Indonesia.</p>
			<p class="desc_ideation">&emsp;&emsp; The solution that Ideator can do to help MSMEs is helping them go-digital. Therefore, we challenge you to provide the best digital marketing strategy. From Ideator for women MSMEs, Indonesia, and the world!</p>
