			<p class="desc_ideation">&emsp;&emsp; A study conducted by National Geographic predicts that by 2040, the amount of waste on earth will reach 1.3 billion tons, both garbage on land and in the ocean.</p>
			<p class="desc_ideation">&emsp;&emsp; Therefore, food waste occupies the highest position in the garbage production, including in Indonesia itself. The high percentage of waste generated certainly affects the climate in Indonesia. Because of this, many natural disasters have occurred, including floods, landslides, coastal erosion, seawater intrusion, waste pollution, waste problems, and others. There is no doubt that the balance and harmony of the relationship between humans and the environment are disturbed.</p>
			<p class="desc_ideation">&emsp;&emsp; Food waste refers to food that is ready for consumption and meets balanced nutrition that is just wasted. Unfortunately, food waste is the biggest contributor to waste in Indonesia. Many impacts are resulting from the production of food waste for the environment, including Food waste-producing methane gas, catastrophic waste explosions, the occurrence of leachate, wasting soil, wasting oil, reducing the diversity of living things, and wasting water.</p>
			<p class="desc_ideation">&emsp;&emsp; Local wisdom in building and managing the environment should be seen from the wisdom of design ideas in treating the natural environment. How to integrate design ideas with the surrounding environment. Local wisdom will always be connected to human life living in a wise environment. Because the environment is a unitary space with all the objects in it, both living and nonliving things.</p>
