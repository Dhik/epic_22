			<p class="desc_ideation">&emsp;&emsp; Currently, the world is being hit by the Covid-19 pandemic which has occurred since the beginning of 2020. Covid-19 is a virus that spreads very quickly and is also a deadly virus. The emergence of Covid-19 caused the whole world to implement policies to reduce the negative impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. Indonesia established a Large-Scale Social Restriction (PSBB) policy which led to several changes in social structures including in the field of education. As a result of the implementation of new policies during the Covid-19 pandemic, the learning system during the pandemic changed. In accordance with the Circular of the Ministry of Education and Culture RI number 4 of 2020 regarding the implementation of education policies in the emergency period of the spread of Coronavirus Disease (Covid-19), the teaching and learning process is carried out from home through online or distance learning.</p>
			<p class="desc_ideation">&emsp;&emsp; Online or distance learning is carried out by using alternative solutions for technical transitional learning using technology media. In its application, the implementation of online learning still has several obstacles. These obstacles include the unpreparedness of educational academics in handling education during the Covid-19 pandemic, limited facilities and infrastructure, and low mastery of technology. These obstacles caused the implementation of education during the Covid-19 pandemic to be less than optimal.</p>
			<p class="desc_ideation">&emsp;&emsp; This impact is also felt by students and educators at the elementary school level. Changes in learning systems and media resulted in a slightly decreased student enthusiasm for learning. Therefore, educators are advised to immediately think about creative learning programs that aim to increase the enthusiasm for learning of elementary school students. In addition to educators, Liblicious contestants can also contribute creative ideas according to the themes provided. The creative learning program focuses on primary school students who are largely affected by changes in learning media during the pandemic. This theme aims to provide a unique learning media for elementary school students who are at their golden age and need guidance in obtaining information. In addition, students' enthusiasm is also expected to increase with the programs offered by competition participants and which can be applied significantly by educational institutions. This theme also prepares students and educators to prepare themselves to apply blended learning that is applied after the pandemic.</p>
