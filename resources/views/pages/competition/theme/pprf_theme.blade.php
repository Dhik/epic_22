			<p class="desc_ideation">&emsp;&emsp; The weakening condition of Indonesian tourism since the Covid-19 pandemic initiated the formation of the CHSE program by the Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy.  CHSE is a certification program for tourism industry players that guarantees that their tourism business has been certified for cleanliness, health, safety and environmental sustainability, so tourists don't have to worry about visiting tourist attractions.  The Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy made the CHSE their main program during the pandemic to prepare tourism industry players to be ready to accept tourists again.  That way, Indonesian tourism can recover from the downturn due to the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>

			<p class="theme-title-li">“Rebuilding Traveller's Trust and Confidence for Tourism Recovery Through Communication Strategy”</p>
			<p class="desc_ideation">&emsp;&emsp; This year PRSF will talk about “Rebuilding Traveller's Trust and Confidence for Tourism Recovery Through Communication Strategy”, which is an interesting topic since tourism sector in Indonesia is one of the sectors that directly contributed the largest amount to GDP, but unfortunately the impact of Covid-19 pandemic has made the tourism sector in Indonesia experience a drastic decline, one of which is the phenomenon of lack of trust of destination. And aligned with that, the phenomenon of lack of trust of destination needs to be solved as soon as possible so that Indonesia can achieve tourism recovery. This is where PR can come into play as a problem-solver to rebuild traveller trust and confidence through communication strategy and help Indonesia to achieve the tourism recovery.</p>
