			<p class="desc_ideation">&emsp;&emsp; The Epicentrum 2021 talk show presented three speakers representing the penta helix concept, namely Donny B. U as the KPCPEN Public Communication Team representing the government, Abie Besman as Executive Producer of Kompas TV representing the media, and M. Fakhri Dwi Ariza as Founder of Kakak Asuh representing the community.</p>
			<p class="desc_ideation">&emsp;&emsp;Donny B.U revealed, “Economic and health problems are inaccessible problems. What we can do together is to comply with “3M” health protocols. With the penta helix, all parts of the government, media, companies, and so on can work together to face this pandemic towards Indonesia Recovery."</p>
			<p class="desc_ideation">&emsp;&emsp;Abie Besman also added, “The media have played a role in changing this pandemic with the intention of government policies and facts on the ground aimed at Covid-19. By becoming the supervisor and coverage of the government, it is hoped that the media can become a part of the penta helix towards recovering Indonesia after the pandemic."</p>
			<p class="desc_ideation">&emsp;&emsp;M. Fakhri Dwi Ariza said that this was independent of the role of students who could determine to help teach kindergarten and elementary school students who live in remote facilities and lack adequate educational support and internet. Furthermore, the community is part of the penta helix effort to deal with a pandemic related to information related to public health, such as in villages that are difficult to reach by the government.</p>
			<p class="desc_ideation">&emsp;&emsp;Thus, all parts of the penta helix play an important role in realizing the Indonesian Recovery with a spirit of cooperation and cooperation between penta helix parts.</p>
			<p class="desc_ideation">&emsp;&emsp;The Epicentrum talk show was supported by several media partnerships such as Jatinangor Banget, Competition Info, RadioMU, Kata Anak Unpad, Student 8 Event, Apa Aja Event, Indonesian Student Event Info, Unpar Radio Station, and Event News. The talk show was attended by 604 participants.</p>
